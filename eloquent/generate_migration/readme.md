# Generate migration files from the existing database

Not yet used on my side.

The package `kitloong/laravel-migrations-generator` [https://github.com/kitloong/laravel-migrations-generator](https://github.com/kitloong/laravel-migrations-generator) will scan the existing database and will generate migration files for each tables.

This can be really useful when the Laravel application was created with migrations but when the developer maintains tables by hand (directly in the database system interface like `phpMyAdmin`).

Documentation and how-to can be found here: [https://github.com/kitloong/laravel-migrations-generator](https://github.com/kitloong/laravel-migrations-generator)
