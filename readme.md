# Laravel Tips & Tricks

![Banner](./banner.svg)

> Collection of Laravel tips and tricks, including some files like artisan command

You'll find here some tips & tricks, artisan commands, batch files, ... to make easier to work with Laravel.

## Artisan tips

### Clear sessions

Custom artisan command for clearing all sessions (both in database and on the filesystem).

#### Installation

Copy [ClearSessions.php](ClearSessions.php) under your `app/console/commands`.

#### Use

From your prompt, run `php artisan session:clear`.

## Eloquent tips

### Disable Lazy Loading 

> [:en: Disable Lazy Loading](https://laracasts.com/series/jeffreys-larabits/episodes/3)

Lazy loading is associated to the **N+1** well-known Laravel features i.e. if we don't pay attention, by running `$post->all()` (getting all blog posts) then by showing their authors `$post->author->email` we can have a loop: for each single blog post, Laravel will run a new query to get the author.

If there are 100 blog posts, we'll run 101 queries. And this silently since we will not see it (unless we're using debug tools like [Laravel Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/master/telescope)).

So, the idea is to prohibit lazy loading and throw a fatal error during development so we can immediately see the problem and solve it.

### Enabling Strict Mode for Eloquent models

> [:en: Laravel's Strict Mode](https://laracasts.com/series/jeffreys-larabits/episodes/29)

Laravel will allow to write `$user->emal` (instead of `$user->email` i.e. with a typo). He'll think that `email` is a valid attribute even if, when displaying it's value, we'll get null or an empty string.

We can force Laravel to be strict and refuse access to inexisting attributes using the **Strict mode**  

## Log in using GitHub, Facebook, ... i.e. with oAuth

> [:en: From Zero to "Log In With GitHub" in Ten Minutes](https://laracasts.com/series/jeffreys-larabits/episodes/25)

Using [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) and [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite) it can be quite easy to offer a `Register with` / `Log in with` feature.

The episode on Laracast is showing in less than 10 minutes how to create an authentication process using GitHub and retrieve back the GitHub id, name, email and token of the visitor. Then create the user in our database so, next time, the user can just click on `Log in with GitHub` button.

What's is nice then, it's the `createOrUpdate` method based on the GitHub id i.e. if the user update his GitHub profile, changes will be made in our application too.
